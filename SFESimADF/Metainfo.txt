Description: 'Simulates Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests for stationary and non-stationary ARMA processes.
The simulated process x(t) is x(t) = alpha x(t-1) + beta epsilon(t-1) + epsilon(t), where the error 
term is a Gaussian White Noise process. Each process is simulated 1000 times. For each simulated process
the number of lags (p) included for the ADF test varies between 3 to 11.'

Keywords:

Output: 'A plot for the power (alpha = 0.9) and the level (alpha = 1) of Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests.
The rejection probability for beta = -0.99 (black), beta = -0.90 (red), beta = 0 (blue), beta = -0.90 
(green) and beta = -0.99 (magenta) depending on the number of included lags are displayed. In addition
two tables for the power and level of the test are printed for the minimum and maximum number of lags (p).'
