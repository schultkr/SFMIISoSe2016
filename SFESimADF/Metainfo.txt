Output: 'A plot for the level (alpha = 0.9) and the power (alpha = 1) of the Augmented-Dickey-Fuller test. The rejection probability for beta = -0.99 (black), beta = -0.90 (red), beta = 0 (blue), beta = -0.90 (green) and beta = -0.99 (magenta) depending on the number of included lags are displayed. Two tables are printed for the minimum and maximum number of lags.'
